# MenuExtensionForWebBrowserSearch

This is a C# extension project which is aimed to add a drop down menu in the Visual Studio Tools menu. The drop down menu will pop up a message box to take value
to be found out and crawls through a website and find the definition, mostly from a company private SDN page for developers.

NOTE: The extension is still under development where UI interface to accept value still needs to be added and the code will eventually be migrated to Mac OS.
